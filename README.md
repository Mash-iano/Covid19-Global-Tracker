# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project analyzes and visualizes the global trends of COVID-19 cases and deaths over time using real-world data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). It aims to provide insights into the spread and impact of the pandemic in selected countries like Kenya, USA, and India.

## 📌 Objectives

- Import and clean real-world COVID-19 data
- Analyze trends of total cases and deaths across time
- Compare daily new cases between countries
- Visualize trends using charts and maps
- Summarize findings with clear narrative explanations

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly.express

## 📈 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run the cells from top to bottom.
4. Ensure you have an active internet connection to load necessary packages and Plotly maps.
5. The dataset used is `owid-covid-data.csv`, which can be downloaded from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data).

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **India** experienced a major COVID-19 surge in mid-2021.
- **USA** had an aggressive early vaccination rollout.
- **Kenya** reported fewer cases, possibly due to lower testing or reporting differences.

Further investigation could explore:
- Testing rates across countries
- Healthcare system capacity and reporting quality
